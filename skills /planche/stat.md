### Pass / Fail vs Progression Criteria

| Criterion            | Requirement | Status |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Sets                 | ≥ 4         | ✅ (4)  |
| Hold length          | 8–12 s each | ✅      |
| Last-set RPE         | ≤ 7         | ❌ (8)  |
| Consecutive sessions | 2           | ❌ (0)  |

> **Verdict:** *Not yet ready* to drop to the red band. Remain on black-band advanced-tuck until the **last-set RPE ≤ 7 for two sessions in a row**.

## 4 Next Action Plan

1. **Aim:** 4-5 × 10 s holds next session, maintain strict form.
2. **Rest:** 90-120 s between sets.
3. **Re-test RPE:** Progress when last-set RPE ≤ 7 for **two sessions**.
