## 2 Latest Session Snapshot (2025-08-09)

### Straddle Planche (black band only)
| Set | Hold (s) | RPE |
| --- | -------- | --- |
| 1   | 4        | -   |

* **Total time-under-tension (TUT):** **4 s**
* **Last-set RPE:** **-**

### Planche Lean Practice
| Set | Hold (s) | RPE |
| --- | -------- | --- |
| 1   | 5        | -   |
| 2   | 5        | -   |
| 3   | 10       | -   |
| 4   | 12       | -   |

* **Total time-under-tension (TUT):** **32 s**
* **Focus:** Form and lean angle development

### Pass / Fail vs Progression Criteria (Straddle progression)

| Criterion            | Requirement | Status |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Sets                 | ≥ 4         | ❌ (1)  |
| Hold length          | 8–12 s each | ❌ (4s) |
| Last-set RPE         | ≤ 7         | ❓ (-) |
| Consecutive sessions | 2           | ❌ (0)  |

> **Verdict:** *Light straddle work* - Single hold with black band assistance. Focus shifted to planche lean development for building fundamental strength and positioning.

## 4 Next Action Plan

1. **Aim:** 4-5 × 10 s holds next session, maintain strict form.
2. **Rest:** 90-120 s between sets.
3. **Re-test RPE:** Progress when last-set RPE ≤ 7 for **two sessions**.
