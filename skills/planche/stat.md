| Set | Hold (s) | RPE |
| --- | -------- | --- |
| 1   | 5        | 7   |
| 2   | 11       | 8   |
| 3   | 10       | 7   |
| 4   | 10       | 8   |
| 5   | 9        | 7   |

* **Total time-under-tension (TUT):** **45 s**
* **Last-set RPE:** **7**

### Pass / Fail vs Progression Criteria

| Criterion            | Requirement | Status |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Sets                 | ≥ 4         | ✅ (5)  |
| Hold length          | 8–12 s each | ✅      |
| Last-set RPE         | ≤ 7         | ✅ (7)  |
| Consecutive sessions | 2           | ❌ (1)  |

> **Verdict:** *Getting closer* to progression criteria. One session meeting RPE ≤ 7. Need **one more session** with RPE ≤ 7 to drop to red band.

## 4 Next Action Plan

1. **Aim:** 4-5 × 10 s holds next session, maintain strict form.
2. **Rest:** 90-120 s between sets.
3. **Re-test RPE:** Progress when last-set RPE ≤ 7 for **two sessions**.
