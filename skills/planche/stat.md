| 2   | 10       | 6   |
| 3   | 10       | 7   |

* **Total time-under-tension (TUT):** **30 s**
* **Focus:** Consistent lean angle and endurance

### Planche Lean Push-ups
| Set | Reps |
| --- | ---- |
| 1   | 10   |
| 2   | 10   |
| 3   | 10   |

### Pass / Fail vs Progression Criteria (Straddle progression)

| Criterion            | Requirement | Status |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Sets                 | ≥ 4         | ✅ (4)  |
| Hold length          | 8–12 s each | ❌ (3-5s)|
| Last-set RPE         | ≤ 7         | ❌ (8)  |
| Consecutive sessions | 2           | ❌ (0)  |

> **Verdict:** *Volume improvement* - Achieved 4 sets of straddle holds with black band (17s TUT). Combined with solid planche lean work (30s) and dynamic push-ups (30 reps). Building comprehensive planche strength.

## 4 Next Action Plan

1. **Aim:** 4-5 × 10 s holds next session, maintain strict form.
2. **Rest:** 90-120 s between sets.
3. **Re-test RPE:** Progress when last-set RPE ≤ 7 for **two sessions**.
