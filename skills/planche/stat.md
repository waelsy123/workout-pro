## 2 Latest Session Snapshot (2025-08-07)

### Straddle Planche (red+black bands)
| Set | Hold (s) | RPE |
| --- | -------- | --- |
| 1   | 4        | 8   |
| 2   | 8        | 7   |
| 3   | 7        | 7   |

* **Total time-under-tension (TUT):** **19 s**
* **Last-set RPE:** **7**

### Straddle Planche (black band only)
| Set | Hold (s) | RPE |
| --- | -------- | --- |
| 1   | 3        | -   |
| 2   | 4        | 9   |
| 3   | 2        | 8   |

* **Total time-under-tension (TUT):** **9 s**
* **Last-set RPE:** **8**

### Pass / Fail vs Progression Criteria (Straddle with red+black)

| Criterion            | Requirement | Status |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Sets                 | ≥ 4         | ❌ (3)  |
| Hold length          | 8–12 s each | ❌ (4-8s)|
| Last-set RPE         | ≤ 7         | ✅ (7)  |
| Consecutive sessions | 2           | ❌ (1)  |

> **Verdict:** *Straddle progression work* - Working on increasing set volume and hold times with dual band assistance. Black-only holds show the challenge level without red band support.

## 4 Next Action Plan

1. **Aim:** 4-5 × 10 s holds next session, maintain strict form.
2. **Rest:** 90-120 s between sets.
3. **Re-test RPE:** Progress when last-set RPE ≤ 7 for **two sessions**.
