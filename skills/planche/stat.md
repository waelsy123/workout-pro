## 2 Latest Session Snapshot (2025-08-09)

### Planche Lean (Preparation/Activation)
| Set | Hold (s) | Notes |
| --- | -------- | ----- |
| 1   | 5        | Warm-up |
| 2   | 5        | Building |
| 3   | 10       | Strong |
| 4   | 12       | Excellent form |

### Straddle Planche (Black band only)
| Set | Hold (s) | RPE |
| --- | -------- | --- |
| 1   | 4        | 8   |

* **Session focus:** Mixed strength/cardio day with planche lean + single straddle attempt
* **Planche lean improvement:** Up to 12s (excellent activation work)
* **Straddle maintenance:** Solid 4s hold with black band

### Pass / Fail vs Progression Criteria

| Criterion                    | Requirement      | Status     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| **MAJOR PROGRESSION MADE!**  | Shape advancement| âœ… Straddle |
| Red+Black combo hold length | 6-10s each       | âœ… (7-8s)   |
| Red+Black combo RPE          | â‰¤ 7              | âœ… (7)      |
| Black-only exploration       | â‰¥ 2s attempts    | âœ… (2-4s)   |

> **Verdict:** ðŸš€ **SHAPE PROGRESSION ACHIEVED!** Successfully transitioned from advanced-tuck to **straddle planche**. Red+black combination shows solid progress. Black-only work provides strength challenge for future development.

## 4 Next Action Plan

1. **STRADDLE DEVELOPMENT:** Continue red+black combination to build strength ðŸ’ª
2. **Target:** 4-5 Ã— 6-10s holds with red+black combo, maintain RPE â‰¤ 7
3. **Challenge work:** Occasional black-only attempts for strength building
4. **Progression goal:** Eventually transition to red-band only straddle
5. **Timeline:** Allow 4-6 sessions to consolidate straddle shape
