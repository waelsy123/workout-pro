## 2 Latest Session Snapshot (2025-08-07)

### Straddle Planche (Red + Black bands)
| Set | Hold (s) | RPE |
| --- | -------- | --- |
| 1   | 4        | 8   |
| 2   | 8        | 7   |
| 3   | 7        | 7   |

### Straddle Planche (Black band only)
| Set | Hold (s) | RPE |
| --- | -------- | --- |
| 1   | 3        | 9   |
| 2   | 4        | 9   |
| 3   | 2        | 8   |

* **Total time-under-tension (TUT):** **28 s**
* **Best progression:** Red+Black combo (8s @7)
* **Challenge level:** Black only (very difficult)

### Pass / Fail vs Progression Criteria

| Criterion                    | Requirement      | Status     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| **MAJOR PROGRESSION MADE!**  | Shape advancement| âœ… Straddle |
| Red+Black combo hold length | 6-10s each       | âœ… (7-8s)   |
| Red+Black combo RPE          | â‰¤ 7              | âœ… (7)      |
| Black-only exploration       | â‰¥ 2s attempts    | âœ… (2-4s)   |

> **Verdict:** ðŸš€ **SHAPE PROGRESSION ACHIEVED!** Successfully transitioned from advanced-tuck to **straddle planche**. Red+black combination shows solid progress. Black-only work provides strength challenge for future development.

## 4 Next Action Plan

1. **STRADDLE DEVELOPMENT:** Continue red+black combination to build strength ðŸ’ª
2. **Target:** 4-5 Ã— 6-10s holds with red+black combo, maintain RPE â‰¤ 7
3. **Challenge work:** Occasional black-only attempts for strength building
4. **Progression goal:** Eventually transition to red-band only straddle
5. **Timeline:** Allow 4-6 sessions to consolidate straddle shape
