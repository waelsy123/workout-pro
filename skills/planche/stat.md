| Criterion                    | Requirement      | Status     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| **MAJOR PROGRESSION MADE!**  | Shape advancement| âœ… Straddle |
| Red+Black combo hold length | 6-10s each       | âœ… (7-8s)   |
| Red+Black combo RPE          | â‰¤ 7              | âœ… (7)      |
| Black-only exploration       | â‰¥ 2s attempts    | âœ… (2-4s)   |

## 4 Next Action Plan

1. **STRADDLE DEVELOPMENT:** Continue red+black combination to build strength ðŸ’ª
2. **Target:** 4-5 Ã— 6-10s holds with red+black combo, maintain RPE â‰¤ 7
3. **Challenge work:** Occasional black-only attempts for strength building
4. **Progression goal:** Eventually transition to red-band only straddle
5. **Timeline:** Allow 4-6 sessions to consolidate straddle shape
