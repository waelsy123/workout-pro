## 1 Key Variables That Drive Progress

| Variable               | Speeds progression                                 | Slows progression                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Training frequency** | 2-3 focused sessions per week                     | 1 session per week or daily grinding       |
| **Recovery quality**   | Adequate sleep, proper nutrition, stress management| Poor recovery, excessive volume            |
| **Starting strength**  | Strong pull-ups (10+ reps), solid hollow body     | Weak pulling base, poor body control       |
| **Body composition**   | Lower body fat, stable weight                     | Higher body fat, significant weight changes|

## 2 Progression Pathway & Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Building
**Prerequisites:** 
- 10+ strict pull-ups
- 30s+ hollow body hold
- 15s+ dead hang

### Phase 2: Tuck Front Lever
**Duration:** 4-8 weeks
- **Hold target:** 15-20s
- **Sets:** 4-6 holds
- **Form:** Tight tuck, shoulders protracted
- **Progression:** When RPE â‰¤ 7 for target hold time

### Phase 3: Advanced Tuck  
**Duration:** 6-12 weeks
- **Hold target:** 12-15s
- **Sets:** 4-5 holds  
- **Form:** Shins parallel to ground
- **Progression:** Consistent holds with good form

### Phase 4: One-Leg Extended
**Duration:** 8-16 weeks
- **Hold target:** 8-12s each leg
- **Sets:** 3-4 holds per leg
- **Form:** One leg straight, one tucked
- **Progression:** Equal strength both sides

### Phase 5: Straddle Front Lever
**Duration:** 12-24 weeks  
- **Hold target:** 6-10s
- **Sets:** 3-4 holds
- **Form:** Wide leg straddle, horizontal torso
- **Progression:** Consistent holds, controlled entry

### Phase 6: Full Front Lever
**Duration:** Ongoing mastery
- **Hold target:** 5s+ initially
- **Sets:** 2-3 quality holds
- **Form:** Perfect horizontal line
- **Mastery:** 15-30s holds, dynamic movements

## 3 Band-Assisted Training Options

### Band Selection Guide
| Phase             | Band Assistance | Focus                    |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Early Tuck**    | Heavy (22mm)    | Learning position        |
| **Advanced Tuck** | Medium (13mm)   | Building endurance       |
| **Straddle**      | Light (6mm)     | Fine-tuning strength     |
| **Full**          | None            | Pure bodyweight mastery  |

### Band Placement Options
1. **Hips:** Most assistance, easier position holding
2. **Feet:** Moderate assistance, better for strength building  
3. **Single leg:** Uneven loading, addresses imbalances

## 4 Technical Requirements

### Essential Form Points
1. **Shoulder position:** Protracted (pushed forward)
2. **Core engagement:** Hollow body throughout
3. **Hip alignment:** Level with shoulders (horizontal)
4. **Leg control:** Active, strong position maintenance
5. **Grip:** Strong, secure bar contact

### Common Form Deviations
- **Sagging hips** â†’ Stronger hollow body, more core work
- **Retracted shoulders** â†’ Focus on protraction strength
- **Bent arms** â†’ Improve straight-arm pulling strength
- **Uneven hips** â†’ Single-side practice, address imbalances

## 5 Training Structure & Volume

### Weekly Schedule (Intermediate)
- **Session 1:** Hold work + negatives
- **Session 2:** Isometric holds + band assistance  
- **Session 3:** Testing + accessory work

### Session Template
```text
Warm-up (8-10 min):
- Pull-ups, dead hangs, hollow body prep

Main Work (15-20 min):
- Primary hold progression: 4-6 sets
- Negatives or easier progression: 2-3 sets  

Accessory (10 min):
- Straight-arm lat work
- Core strengthening
- Band-assisted practice
```

## 6 Strength Benchmarks

| Progression Level    | Pull-up Strength | Hold Duration | RPE Target |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| **Tuck**             | 10+ reps         | 15-20s        | 7          |
| **Advanced Tuck**    | 12+ reps         | 12-15s        | 7          |
| **One-Leg**          | 15+ reps         | 8-12s         | 8          |
| **Straddle**         | 18+ reps         | 6-10s         | 8          |
| **Full**             | 20+ reps         | 5s+           | 9          |

## 7 Progression Decision Matrix

### Advance to Next Level When:
- **Hold duration** meets target for current level
- **Last set RPE** â‰¤ 7 for two consecutive sessions  
- **Form quality** remains consistent throughout holds
- **Entry/exit** controlled and smooth

### Stay at Current Level When:
- Struggling to complete target holds
- Form breaks down significantly
- RPE > 8 on final sets
- Inconsistent between sessions

### ðŸ“Œ Bottom Line

1. **Master each phase:** Don't rush progressions
2. **Quality over quantity:** Perfect holds beat long sloppy ones
3. **Consistent training:** Regular practice beats sporadic intensity  
4. **Listen to your body:** Joint health trumps progression speed
