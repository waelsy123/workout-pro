## 3 Progression Benchmarks

### Current Level Assessment

| Benchmark              | Target | Current | Status |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------- | ------ |
| **Advanced Tuck Hold** | 12-15s | 11s     | 🎯 73%  |
| **Consistent RPE**     | ≤ 7    | 8       | 🎯      |
| **Session Count**      | 8-12   | 4       | 📊     |
| **Pull-up Strength**   | 15+    | 12      | 🎯 80%  |

> **Current Level:** Mid-Advanced Tuck (approaching One-Leg progression)

## 4 Pass/Fail vs Progression Criteria

| Criterion              | Requirement | Status |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Hold duration          | 12-15s      | ❌ (11s)|
| Last-set RPE           | ≤ 7         | ❌ (8)  |
| Consecutive sessions   | 2           | ❌ (0)  |
| Form consistency       | Good        | ✅      |

> **Verdict:** *Continue advanced tuck training*. Focus on extending holds and reducing RPE before progressing to one-leg extension.

## 8 Next Phase Action Plan

### Short-term Goals (2-4 weeks)
1. **Primary:** Achieve 12-15s advanced tuck holds
2. **RPE target:** Reduce to RPE 7 on final sets  
3. **Frequency:** Maintain 2-3 sessions per week
4. **Accessory:** Add straight-arm lat pulldowns

### Progression Criteria to One-Leg
- **2 consecutive sessions** with 12s+ holds at RPE ≤ 7
- **Pull-up strength** improved to 15+ reps
- **Consistent form** across all working sets

### Training Focus
```text
Primary: 4-5 sets advanced tuck holds
Target: 12-15s duration, RPE ≤ 7
Rest: 2-3 min between sets
Accessory: Straight-arm work, core strengthening
```

> **Next milestone:** One-leg extended front lever (8-12s holds)
