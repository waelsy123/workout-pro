## 1 Key Variables That Drive Progress

| Variable               | Speeds progression                                 | Slows progression                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Training frequency** | Daily practice (5-10 min minimum)                 | 1-2 sessions per week                      |
| **Consistency**        | Same time daily, focused sessions                 | Sporadic practice, distracted training     |
| **Wrist prep**         | Proper warm-up, mobility work                     | Cold starts, inadequate preparation        |
| **Balance focus**      | Fingertip micro-corrections, hollow body          | Muscling through, arched back              |

## 2 Progression Phases & Criteria

### Phase 1: Wall-Supported Foundation
**Goal:** Build strength and alignment
- **Duration:** 2-4 weeks
- **Sets:** 4-6 Ã— 30-60s holds
- **Criteria:** Maintain hollow body, straight line
- **Progression:** When 60s holds feel easy (RPE â‰¤ 6)

### Phase 2: Chest-to-Wall Handstand  
**Goal:** Learn proper hand placement and balance
- **Duration:** 4-8 weeks  
- **Sets:** 4-6 Ã— 15-45s holds
- **Criteria:** Minimal wall contact, active shoulders
- **Progression:** When 30s+ holds with light wall touch

### Phase 3: Kick-up Practice
**Goal:** Develop kick-up timing and initial balance
- **Duration:** 4-12 weeks
- **Sets:** 20-40 kick-up attempts
- **Criteria:** Consistent vertical alignment on kick-up
- **Progression:** When 3+ second balance holds achieved

### Phase 4: Freestanding Balance
**Goal:** Extend hold times through fingertip balance
- **Duration:** Ongoing
- **Sets:** Multiple short holds (5-30s)
- **Criteria:** Controlled entry and exit, minimal walking
- **Progression:** Progressive hold time increases

## 3 Balance Skill Benchmarks

| Milestone                | Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------------ | -------- |
| **Wall hold**            | 30s      | 60s          | 90s+     |
| **Chest-to-wall**        | 15s      | 30s          | 45s+     |
| **Freestanding hold**    | 3s       | 15s          | 60s+     |
| **Kick-up success rate** | 20%      | 60%          | 90%+     |

## 4 Technical Focus Points

### Essential Form Cues
1. **Hand placement:** Shoulder-width, fingers spread wide
2. **Hollow body:** Ribs down, glutes engaged
3. **Active shoulders:** Push floor away, create space
4. **Leg position:** Straight legs, toes pointed up
5. **Head position:** Neutral, eyes between hands

### Common Corrections
- **Banana back** â†’ Engage core, tuck ribs
- **Collapsed shoulders** â†’ Active shoulder extension  
- **Scissor legs** â†’ Practice wall holds for alignment
- **Over-kicking** â†’ Lighter kick, focus on control

## 5 Session Structure Template

```text
Warm-up (5 min):
- Wrist circles, push-ups, hollow body holds

Strength Work (10-15 min):
- Wall holds or chest-to-wall practice
- Focus: form quality over duration

Balance Practice (10-15 min):  
- Kick-up attempts or freestanding holds
- Focus: consistency and control

Cool-down (3 min):
- Wrist stretches, forearm massage
```

### ðŸ“Œ Bottom Line

1. **Consistency beats intensity:** Daily short sessions > weekly long sessions
2. **Quality over quantity:** Perfect form in shorter holds
3. **Progressive overload:** Gradually increase hold times and difficulty
4. **Listen to wrists:** Stop if pain develops, focus on mobility
