## 🎯 Skills Progression

### Current Skills Status

**Planche**: Advanced tuck with black band (9-17kg resistance) for 10 seconds consistently. Currently working on reducing assistance to red band (3-9kg resistance).

### Skill Categories

- **Planche**: Static strength hold progression
- **Front Lever**: Static strength hold progression
- **Handstand**: Balance and strength development
- **Weighted Pull-ups**: Upper body strength building

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Daily Logs Format

Each workout is logged with the following structure:
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Warm-up**: Mobility and activation exercises
- **Exercises**: Main training with sets, reps, and RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)
- **Equipment**: Resistance bands or additional weight used
- **Stretching**: Cool-down and flexibility work

### Exercise Notation

- **Sets**: `reps@rpe` (e.g., `10@8` = 10 reps at RPE 8)
- **Failure**: `fail@fail(reason)` (e.g., balance, strength)
- **Equipment**: Noted for assisted exercises (e.g., "black band")

## 🔧 Resistance Bands System

### Band Specifications

| Color    | Width | Resistance Range | Usage |
|----------|-------|------------------|--------|
| Yellow   | 6mm   | 0-3 kg          | Light assistance |
| Red      | 13mm  | 3-9 kg          | Medium assistance |
| Black    | 22mm  | 9-17 kg         | Heavy assistance |
| Purple   | 32mm  | 17-22 kg        | Very heavy assistance |
| Green    | 44mm  | 22-32 kg        | Maximum assistance |

**Set includes**: 5 bands (6-44mm widths)
**Dimensions**: 100cm length, 200cm circumference

### Usage Guidelines

Bands are primarily used for:
- Skill progression assistance (planche, front lever)
- Gradual load reduction as strength improves
- Controlled progression from heavy to light assistance

## 📈 Latest Workout Summary

**Date**: July 15, 2025

**Key Highlights**:
- Advanced tuck planche with black band: 4 sets (9-11 reps @ RPE 8-9)
- Weighted pull-ups: Progressive loading up to +17.5kg
- Handstand practice: Balance-focused training
- Wall handstand push-ups on parallettes: 3 sets of 4 reps

**Current Focus**: Reducing planche assistance from black band to red band while maintaining form and hold duration.

## 🎯 Training Goals

1. **Planche Progression**: Transition from black band assistance to red band
2. **Strength Development**: Continue weighted pull-up progression
3. **Balance Skills**: Improve handstand consistency and duration
4. **Flexibility**: Maintain mobility through regular stretching

## 📝 Usage

1. **Daily Logging**: Record workouts in `logs/YYYY/M/DD.MM.YYYY` format
2. **Progress Updates**: Update `progress/stats.md` with current skill levels
3. **Skill Tracking**: Document progression milestones in respective skill folders
