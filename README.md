## 🎯 Skills Progression

### Current Skills Status

**Planche**: 🚀 **STRADDLE PLANCHE ACHIEVED!** Successfully progressed to straddle shape with red+black band combination (8s @RPE 7). Major breakthrough from advanced-tuck progression.

### Skill Categories

- **Planche**: Static strength hold progression
- **Front Lever**: Static strength hold progression
- **Handstand**: Balance and strength development
- **Weighted Pull-ups**: Upper body strength building

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Daily Logs Format

Each workout is logged with the following structure:
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Warm-up**: Mobility and activation exercises
- **Exercises**: Main training with sets, reps, and RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion)
- **Equipment**: Resistance bands or additional weight used
- **Stretching**: Cool-down and flexibility work

### Exercise Notation

- **Sets**: `reps@rpe` (e.g., `10@8` = 10 reps at RPE 8)
- **Failure**: `fail@fail(reason)` (e.g., balance, strength)
- **Equipment**: Noted for assisted exercises (e.g., "black band")

## 🔧 Resistance Bands System

### Band Specifications

| Color    | Width | Resistance Range | Usage |
|----------|-------|------------------|--------|
| Yellow   | 6mm   | 0-3 kg          | Light assistance |
| Red      | 13mm  | 3-9 kg          | Medium assistance |
| Black    | 22mm  | 9-17 kg         | Heavy assistance |
| Purple   | 32mm  | 17-22 kg        | Very heavy assistance |
| Green    | 44mm  | 22-32 kg        | Maximum assistance |

**Set includes**: 5 bands (6-44mm widths)
**Dimensions**: 100cm length, 200cm circumference

### Usage Guidelines

Bands are primarily used for:
- Skill progression assistance (planche, front lever)
- Gradual load reduction as strength improves
- Controlled progression from heavy to light assistance

## 📈 Latest Workout Summary

**Date**: August 11, 2025

**Key Highlights**:
- 🔥 **Handstand NEW PB**: 12-second freestanding hold achieved (TWICE!)
- 🚀 **Weighted Pull-ups**: BW + 18kg × 5 reps breakthrough
- **Straddle Planche**: Consistent 5s holds with black band + volume work
- **Training Innovation**: Wall/freestanding alternating protocol

**Current Focus**: Approaching 15s handstand benchmark (only 3s away!) and consolidating straddle planche progression.

## 🎯 Training Goals

1. **Straddle Planche**: Consolidate straddle shape and transition to red band assistance
2. **Handstand Mastery**: Achieve 15-second freestanding hold (intermediate benchmark)
3. **Strength Development**: Progress weighted pull-ups beyond +18kg × 5 reps
4. **Skill Integration**: Continue developing multiple movement patterns simultaneously

## 📝 Usage

1. **Daily Logging**: Record workouts in `logs/YYYY/M/DD.md` format
2. **Progress Updates**: Update `progress/stats.md` with current skill levels
3. **Skill Tracking**: Document progression milestones in respective skill folders
4. **Session Documentation**: Major processing sessions documented in `session-summaries/`

## 📋 Session Summaries

The `session-summaries/` directory contains detailed documentation of major workout log processing sessions, including:

- **Individual Workout Summaries**: Detailed breakdown of each session's achievements
- **Milestone Tracking**: Documentation of major breakthroughs and progressions  
- **Session Indices**: Overview of processing sessions with comprehensive change logs
- **Training Insights**: Analysis of methodologies and innovations

Latest session: `2025-08-11/` - 5 workout logs processed with multiple major milestones achieved.
